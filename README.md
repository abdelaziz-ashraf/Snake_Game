# Snake_Game
Simple and small game using Python and PyGame.
All of us know snake game and played it before .. I just want to practice and remember my childhood, so i made this game.

## How Game Works?
- The snake moves in 4 directions [Up, Right, Down, Left].
- The game genreates 1 fruit and when snake eats it he genreates another one and so on.
- When the snake eats fruit, its kength increases by one heart.
- The snake loses when it hits the edges of the screen game or its body. 
- When you lose, you can start a new game.
